            <h2>Copa America 2021 Final Highlights</h2>
            <p>
                Lionel Messi's Argentina beat Brazil 1-0 in Sunday's Copa America final to secure the national team's
                first title in 28 years and the superstar's first major international trophy.
                When the match ended, a tearful Messi was thrown into the air by some of his joyous teammates.
                Argentina's winning goal at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro came in the 22nd minute after Rodrigo
                de Paul made a long pass to Ángel di Maria. The 33-year-old veteran striker counted on some sloppy
                defending from left-back Renan Lodi to take control and lob it past goalkeeper Ederson.
